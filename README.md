# ðŸ’¡ Notes
## How to create a Python Virtual Enviroment named `venv`
### Create `venv`
```
python -m venv venv
```

### Activate `venv`

* Activate `venv` in **Windows**
```
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

* Activate `venv` in **Linux**
```
source venv/bin/activate
```


### Intall python packages

```
pip install jupyter "jupyterlab>=3" "ipywidgets>=7.6"
pip install pandas matplotlib requests seaborn scipy scikit-learn optuna plotly==5.18.0 tensorflow[and-cuda]
```

### Test TF2 installation

* It should print list of all your GPUs
    * It is not working if an empty list `[]` is printed

```python
python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
```
