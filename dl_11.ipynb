    "## 🏭 Consumption Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural gas consumption data comes from Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, with a distribution network serving 422,926 customers in 2018 and total consumption of 3.82 billion m³. The consumption is distributed across:\n",

    "- **🏘️ Residential sector**: 381,914 households (33.3% of consumption)\n",
    "- **🏢 Industrial sector**: \n",
    "  - 177 large customers (24.8%)\n",
    "  - 39,175 medium customers (18.9%)\n",
    "  - 1,652 small customers (21.9%)\n",

    "- Activation criteria: Temperature below +13°C for two consecutive days with no forecast warming\n",
    "- Significance: Accounts for approximately 70-75% of annual consumption\n",

    "## 🌡️ Weather Variables\n",

    "Weather data was collected from the Prague LKPR airport weather station through METAR (aerodrome routine meteorological report) information. These standardized reports are regularly issued by airports and maintained in long-term archives, providing reliable meteorological data for our analysis.\n",

    "- **Economic Indicators** 💹: Natural gas price data from the Czech energy regulation office, which affects consumption behavior but is determined by broader market forces.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. **Transformer Block: Like a Team of Time Detectives** 🕵️♂️🕵️♀️  \n",
    "*Imagine 3 experts analyzing a week's weather data to predict tomorrow's temperature:*\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Simplified analogy:\n",
    "def transformer_encoder(inputs):\n",
    "    1. Normalize data → \"Standardize measurements between -1 and 1\"\n",
    "    2. MultiHeadAttention → \"Experts compare Tuesday vs Friday humidity patterns\"\n",
    "    3. Combine insights → \"They agree rain on Monday affects Friday's pressure\"\n",
    "    4. Feed-Forward → \"Convert findings to temperature predictions\"\n",
    "    5. Final Combine → \"Merge new insights with original observations\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components:\n",
    "- **Layer Normalization** 📏  \n",
    "  *Example:* Scales all temperature readings to comparable ranges (-1 to 1) before analysis  \n",
    "  *Why?* Prevents Monday's 30°C from dominating Friday's 15°C in calculations  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Head Attention** 👥  \n",
    "  *Analogy:* 4 specialists (num_heads=4) each study different relationships:\n",
    "  - Head 1: Hourly temperature changes\n",
    "  - Head 2: Weekly season patterns\n",
    "  - Head 3: Weather ↔ electricity demand links\n",
    "  - Head 4: Holiday effect correlations  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feed-Forward Network** 🧠  \n",
    "  *Example:* Takes detected patterns and transforms them through:  \n",
    "  `Dense Layer 1 (FFN)`: \"If humidity > 70% and temp < 5°C → snow likely\"  \n",
    "  `Dense Layer 2`: \"Convert snow prediction to energy demand estimate\"  \n",

    "### 2. **Positional Encoding: The Time Calendar** 📅⏰  \n",
    "*Why needed?* Transformers don't automatically understand sequence order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# For a 24-hour time series:\n",
    "Position 0 (Midnight): [sin(0/10000⁰), cos(0/10000¹), sin(0/10000²), ...]\n",
    "Position 23 (11 PM): [sin(23/10000⁰), cos(23/10000¹), sin(23/10000²), ...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Real-world analogy:*  \n",
    "- Each position (hour) gets unique \"time ID\" using alternating sine/cosine waves  \n",
    "- Even positions use sine → \"How unique is this hour?\"  \n",
    "- Odd positions use cosine → \"Where does this hour fall in daily cycle?\"  \n",

    "---\n",

    "### 3. **Complete Workflow Example** 🛠️  \n",
    "*Predicting tomorrow's temperature using 7-day history:*\n",
