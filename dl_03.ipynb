    "Alexander Sawchuk estimates that it was in June or July of 1973 when he, then an assistant professor of electrical engineering at the USC Signal and Image Processing Institute (SIPI), along with a graduate student and the SIPI lab manager, was hurriedly searching the lab for a good image to scan for a colleague's conference paper. They had tired of their stock of usual test images, dull stuff dating back to television standards work in the early 1960s. They wanted something glossy to ensure good output dynamic range, and they wanted a human face. Just then, somebody happened to walk in with a recent issue of Playboy.\n",

    "The engineers tore away the top third of the centerfold so they could wrap it around the drum of their Muirhead wirephoto scanner, which they had outfitted with analog-to-digital converters (one each for the red, green, and blue channels) and a Hewlett Packard 2100 minicomputer. The Muirhead had a fixed resolution of 100 lines per inch and the engineers wanted a 512 x 512 image, so they limited the scan to the top 5.12 inches of the picture, effectively cropping it at the subject's shoulders.\n",

    "## Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling is a way how to decrease the amount of information transfered from one layer to another.\n",
    "The standard way ho to do it is Average Pooling and Maximum Pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pooling results in (some) invariance to translation because shifting the image slightly does not change the activation map significantly. This property is referred to as translation invariance. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The idea is that similar images often have very different relative locations of the distinctive shapes within them, and translation invariance helps in being able to classify such images in a similar way. \n",
    "    - For example, one should be able to classify a bird as a bird, irrespective of where it occurs in the image.\n",
    "    - Disadvantege is that you can for example succesfully classify image as face even though the position of eyes and mouth is switched, because model doesn't care about location of features in the image, their presence is for the model enough\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Avg. pooling is rarely used, usually we use max-pooling in the hidden layers, the only exception might be the last layer, where avg. pooling can significantly reduce the number of parameters.\n",
    "- One alternative to using fully connected layers is to use average pooling across the whole spatial area of the final set of activation maps to create a single value. \n",
    "    - Therefore, the number of features created in the final spatial layer will be exactly equal to the number of filters. In this scenario, if the final activation maps are of size 7 × 7 × 256, then 256 features will be created. \n",
    "    - Each feature will be the result of aggregating 49 values. This type of approach greatly reduces the parameter footprint of the fully connected layers\n",

    "    - It makes the landscape of the corresponding optimization problem be significantly more smooth. This ensures, in particular, that the gradients are more predictive and thus allow for use of larger range of learning rates and faster network convergence\n",
