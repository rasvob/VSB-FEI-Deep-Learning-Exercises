They had tired of their stock of usual test images, dull stuff dating back to television standards work in the early 1960s. They wanted something glossy to ensure good output dynamic range, and they wanted a human face. Just then, somebody happened to walk in with a recent issue of Playboy.\n",

    "The engineers tore away the top third of the centerfold so they could wrap it around the drum of their Muirhead wirephoto scanner, which they had outfitted with analog-to-digital converters (one each for the red, green, and blue channels) and a Hewlett Packard 2100 minicomputer. The Muirhead had a fixed resolution of 100 lines per inch and the engineers wanted a 512 x 512 image, so they limited the scan to the top 5.12 inches of the picture, effectively cropping it at the subject's shoulders.\n",

    "## 📒 Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling is a way how to decrease the amount of information transfered from one layer to another.\n",
    "The standard way ho to do it is Average Pooling and Maximum Pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pooling results in (some) invariance to translation because shifting the image slightly does not change the activation map significantly. This property is referred to as translation invariance. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The idea is that similar images often have very different relative locations of the distinctive shapes within them, and translation invariance helps in being able to classify such images in a similar way. \n",
    "    - For example, one should be able to classify a bird as a bird, irrespective of where it occurs in the image.\n",
    "    - Disadvantege is that you can for example succesfully classify image as face even though the position of eyes and mouth is switched, because model doesn't care about location of features in the image, their presence is for the model enough\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Avg. pooling is rarely used, usually we use max-pooling in the hidden layers, the only exception might be the last layer, where avg. pooling can significantly reduce the number of parameters.\n",
    "- One alternative to using fully connected layers is to use average pooling across the whole spatial area of the final set of activation maps to create a single value. \n",
    "    - Therefore, the number of features created in the final spatial layer will be exactly equal to the number of filters. In this scenario, if the final activation maps are of size 7 × 7 × 256, then 256 features will be created. \n",
    "    - Each feature will be the result of aggregating 49 values. This type of approach greatly reduces the parameter footprint of the fully connected layers\n",

    "* We can make out ANN better by architecture design changes or we can focus on detailts of the architecture such as activation functions or adding some helpful layers\n",
    "    * e.g. Dropout, Batch. norm, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📒 Batch normalization\n",
    "- If we have some two input variables with scales from 0 to 1 and from 0 to 1000 we can normalize them\n",
    "    - Larger scale does not mean that the varible is more important than the other one\n",
    "    - It's clear that without normalization one weight will be very high and other very low to balance the scale difference\n",
    "    - This leads to slow gradient descent convergence - we need small learning rates\n",
    "        - Loss function space is not smooth - gradients may oscillate back and forth before finding optimum\n",
    "        \n",
    "- This issue is present in hidden layers as well due to the mini-batch learning\n",
    "    - Each batch is different from others from distributions point of view\n",
    "    - Covariate shift effect - distribution of data is constantly changing during training\n",
    "        - E.g. We train model on images of black cats - we learn how to map input X to output Y\n",
    "        - If we now use images of colored cats for testing purposes the model will fail - input X changed thus learned mapping is invalid \n",
    "        - This shift happens internally with mini-batches all the time\n",
    "        \n",
    "- 📌 **Batch norm. standardize activation values to have same mean and variance among batch**\n",
    "    - Slight regularization - it adds some noise to each hidden layer’s activations so less overfitting\n",
    "    - We can use higher learning rates because batch normalization makes sure that there’s no activation that’s gone really high or really low\n",
    "    - It makes the landscape of the corresponding optimization problem be significantly more smooth. This ensures, in particular, that the gradients are more predictive and thus allow for use of larger range of learning rates and faster network convergence\n",
    "    \n",
    "- 💡 Keras: tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization\n",
    "    - https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization\n",
    "    - Usually after Conv or Dense layers\n",
    "    - There are of course multiple different approaches where the batch norm. can be placed\n",
    " \n",
    "## 📒 Activation function choice\n",
    "* We can use any activation function we want, very common choice is ReLU or Leaky ReLU\n",
    "* Another very popular activation function nowadays is **Mish (Self Regularized Non-Monotonic Activation Function)**\n",
    "* It's not only one, there are more Swish etc.\n",
